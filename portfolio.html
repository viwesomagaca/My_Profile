			<p>I started doing coding in 2012, I was studing my Information Technology course in Damelin College. That is where i first got introduced to HTML and CSS, I was able to create static web pages. I also got a small introduction to few programming languages
				which were C sharp, Java, and Visual Basic I then did my Cisco Certified Network Associate certificate in College of Cape Town, Thats where i was introduced to communication between devices,Switches,Networks, Hubs and Repeaters.
			</p>

			<p> Soon after that was introduced to codex, a program that equips young people with a foundation of coding skills, Attitude, and other survival tactics in the tech world, this is where I learnt about indepth about coding, other coding skills and tools.
				I also learnt alot about Agile Practices and Scrum Values. </p>

	    Software development not just about the code. Here’s a couple of things I think I’m good at: </p>

	    <p>Teamwork — It is important to work well with your mates, It also helps you to Learn from them. </p>
	    <p>Business Environment - A client is very Precious, put clients first and empathise with them. </p>
	    <p>Collaboration — I’d happy to integrate into your existing team to help get your project implemented. </p>
	    <p>Communication —  I use tools like Kanbans,slack,Stand Ups & Retrospectives to make sure we’re always on the same page. </p>
	    <p>Timekeeping — With tools like time - boxing, it helps me get things done in a more quicker and efficient way </p>
	    <p>Attitude - It goes a long way, It does not just determine who you are, but what you are about, your product aswell. </p>
